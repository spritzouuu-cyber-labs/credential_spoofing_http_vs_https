Hello,

This file is a step by step process to execute this whole lab.

With that I mean:
 - setting up the virtual environment
 - downloading the needed tools
 - creating of the http/https server
 - creating the self made certificate for https
 - the needed form code to give username and password as input
 - wireshark interception for both http and https
 - explanation why http can be view in clear and https not
 - mitigations

To complete this lab I suggest to use a virtual machine, personally I use a parrot OS security edition. You can download the ova file from this link https://parrotsec.org/ you can then import the ova on you chosen hypervisor, personally I use oracle virtualbox https://www.oracle.com/europe/virtualization/technologies/vm/downloads/virtualbox-downloads.html.
